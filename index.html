	<h1>Speed...!!!</h1>
	<p> Speeds of all kinds have always fascinated mankind from the begining,from the speed of the car,to the speed of computer,to the speed of network and hence forth.</p>
	<p>Lets talk about history of cars and how humans have managed to engineer cars to thier incredible speeds. </p>
	<h2>History Of Cars</h2>

	<p>The whole concept of vehicles started with the invention of wheels,though the place and time of "invention" remains unclear but has been credited to the <strong><em>Elamites</em></strong> because their sculptures are the earliest to portray it.</p>
	<h2>The First Car </h2>
		<p>In the year 1886 <strong>Karl Benz</strong> a German inventor patented his <em>Benz Patent-Motorwagen</em>. </p>

		<p>It is a three wheeled automobile with a rear-mounted engine. It was a single cylinder four-stroke engine. A single belt system served as a single-speed transmission, varying torque between an open disc and drive disc.Steering was by way of a toothed rack that pivoted the unsprung front wheel.</p>
	<h2> Evolution </h2>
	<p> As the years passed cars started evolving as the most useful means of transport. They moved from three wheels to four , from two-stroke to four-stroke, from a simple design to complicated design, from a small engine to a sophisticated highly powerful engines. Nowadays cars are known for their speed, luxury and comfort means of road transport.</p>
		<h3>Evolution Of Engines</h3>
		<p>The first reliable engine was a two stroke gasoline engine which ran for the first time on 'New Year's Eve' 1879, developed by <strong>Karl Benz</strong>. Benz had so much commercial success with this engine that he was able to devote more time to his dream of creating a lightweight car powered by a gasoline engine, in which the chassis and engine formed a single unit.</p>
		<p> It was in the year 1885, his dreams came true when his two-seater vehicle was mounted with compact high-speed single-cylinder four-stroke engine horizontally at the rear,the tubular steel frame, the differential and three wire-spoked wheels. The engine output was 0.75 hp (0.55 kW). Details included an automatic intake slide, a controlled exhaust valve, high-voltage electrical vibrator ignition with spark plug, and water/thermo siphon evaporation cooling.</p><br>

		<p> Early internal combustion engines were stareted by hand cranking. Today we use electrical starters to ignite our engines.
		The first piston engines did not have compression, but ran on an air-fuel mixture sucked or blown in during the first part of the intake stroke. The most significant distinction between modern internal combustion engines and the early designs is the use of compression of the fuel charge prior to combustion.</p>
		<p>The series of development and engineering has led to production of much powerful engines which are capable of reaching speeds which were once thought impossible to be reached.</p>
		<p>The era of prteol engines is approaching to an end, as much efficient and powerful electric engines are taking over the market, with their advantage of instant torque they have managed to huge audience in their favour. But the major stap towards eco-friendly products have gained a lot of public interest.</p>
		<p>Though we so so much improvement along these year, the thirst for speed has not yet been quenched. The race to make the fastest car is never ending and will be the reason for the keen interest and longingness of people for speed </p>
