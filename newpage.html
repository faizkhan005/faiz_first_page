			<p>The phase supercar did not become popular until much later and is said to have its revival originated with British motor journalist L. J. K. Setright writing about the Lamborghini Miura in CAR in the mid-1960s. The magazine was originally launched in 1962 as Small Car and Mini Owner, and claims to have “coined the phrase”.</p>
			<p>In the United States, the term “supercar” predates the classification of muscle car to describe the “dragstrip bred” affordable mid-size cars of the 1960s and early 1970s that were equipped with large, powerful V8 engines and rear wheel drive.</p>
			<p>In late 4o's 'sporting' road cars were introduced from now famous companies such as Ferrari, Jagur, Lotus and Prosche. These were designed for both daily commute as well as motorsport competition.</p>
			<p>In 1954, the Mercedes 300SL Gullwing was launched, with an incredible 3 liter fuel injected engine producing 240bhp claimed a to speed of 266 km/hr.</p>
